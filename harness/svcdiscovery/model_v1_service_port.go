	// The application protocol for this port. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. +optional
	AppProtocol string `json:"appProtocol,omitempty"`
	// The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service. +optional
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport +optional
	NodePort int32 `json:"nodePort,omitempty"`
	// The port that will be exposed by this service.
	Port int32 `json:"port,omitempty"`
	// The IP protocol for this port. Supports \"TCP\", \"UDP\", and \"SCTP\". Default is TCP. +default=\"TCP\" +optional
