# V1ObjectReference

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ApiVersion** | **string** | API version of the referent. +optional | [optional] [default to null]
**FieldPath** | **string** | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: \&quot;spec.containers{name}\&quot; (where \&quot;name\&quot; refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified \&quot;spec.containers[2]\&quot; (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future. +optional | [optional] [default to null]
