type V1PodFailurePolicyRule struct {
	// Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are: - FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all   running pods are terminated. - Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not   incremented and a replacement pod is created. - Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the   counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented. Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.
