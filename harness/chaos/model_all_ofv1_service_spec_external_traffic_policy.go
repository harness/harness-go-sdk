// externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. \"Local\" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. \"Cluster\" obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading. +optional
